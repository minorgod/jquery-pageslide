# jQuery PageSlide

PageSlide is a jQuery plugin which slides a webpage over to reveal an additional interaction pane.

**Note: This respository is not actively maintained. In fact, I don't recommend using it. There are plenty of [alternatives out there](http://www.unheap.com/section/navigation/drawer-responsive/).**

## Demo

There are a couple of examples included with this package. Or, if you can't wait to download it, see it live on the [responsive demo](http://srobbin.github.com/jquery-pageslide) or [original project page](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/pageslide/).

## Options

### speed

The speed at which the page slides over. Accepts standard jQuery effects speeds (e.g. 'fast', 'normal' or milliseconds). (default=200)

### direction

Which direction does the page slide? Accepts 'left' or 'right'. (default='right')

### modal

By default, when pageslide opens, you can click on the document to close it. If modal is set to 'true', then you must explicitly close PageSlide using $.pageslide.close(); (default=false)

### iframe

By default, linked pages are loaded into an iframe. Set this to false if you don't want an iframe. (default=true)

### href

Override the source of the content. Optional in most cases, but required when opening pageslide programmatically (e.g. <code>$.pageslide({ href: '#some-element' });</code> ) (default=null)

### slideBody

By default, the body of the page slides over to make room for the sliding panel. You can override this and make the panel overlap the body by setting slideBody to false.

### userCallback

You can pass a function via the userCallback option and this function will be called when the sliding panel finishes opening or closing. 

## Setup

In the HEAD tag:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jquery.pageslide.css">
```

Ideally, near the bottom of the page.
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.pageslide.min.js"></script>
```

To use, call pageslide on an <code><a></code> tag that either links to a page or an anchor of a hidden element.
```
<script type="text/javascript">
    $('a').pageslide();
</script>
```

Or, open pageslide programatically:
```
<script type="text/javascript">
    $.pageslide({ href: '#some-element' });
    $.pageslide({ href: 'some-page.html' });
</script>
```

To close pageslide programatically:
```
<script type="text/javascript">
    $.pageslide.close();
</script>
```
